|**Materials**|Course lecture notes and assignments will be provided via the course [Canvas file system](https://umich.instructure.com/courses/705903). An additional shadow site is maintained in [Github](https://github.com/nomelabs/NERS521). Base course notes are published prior to lecture and avaiable for download. These slides are used in lecture and marked up using an iPad over the course of the lecture. Course notes with the mark up are provided via Canvas no later than 48 hrs after the corresponding lecture (usually much earlier). CAEN automated lecture recordings will also be enabled/provided.|
|**Activities**|The majority of the class meetings will consist of lectures with homework assigned for out of classroom learning and development.|
|**Attendance**|Official attendance is not taken, but you are strongly encouraged to attend lectures as it is easy to get behind in the course content. If you miss a class because of sickness, emergency, research conference, etc. please let me know and I will try to provide additional materials (e.g. previous recorded course lectures) to make sure you stay current in the class.|
|**Grading**|40% Homework <br />30% Midterm exam <br />30% Final exam|
|**Late Assignment Policy**|<24 hrs: 75%; <48 hrs: 50%, >48 hrs: 25%.|
|**Letter Grade Assignment**|>95% A+, >90% A, >85% A-, >80% B+, >75% B, >70% B-, >65 D+ |
|**Generative AI Use Statement**|In principle you may submit material that contains AI-generated content, or is based on or derived from it, as long as this use is properly documented. This includes for example drafting an outline, preparing individual sections, combining elements and removing redundant parts, and compiling and annotating references. Your documentation must make the process transparent â€“ the submission itself must meet our standards of attribution and validation. |
|**Pandemic Statement**|As they have throughout the past year and a half, policies around academic and public health are subject to change as this pandemic evolves. This course will follow all policies issued by the University, which are documented on the [Campus Blueprint's FAQ](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/faqs/). These policies may change over the course of the term, so please review the [Campus Blueprint's FAQ](https://campusblueprint.umich.edu/faqs/) for the most up to date information.|
|**Honor Code Statement**|It is expected all material and submitted assignments will be your own, original work. For the case of homework assignments, group study and discussion are acceptable and encouraged, but the submitted assignments must have been completed in full by yourself. Exams should be taken independently. At the time of the exam, the use of outside material will be discussed. Any evidence of non-original work or co-dependent exam completion will be considered a possible Honor Code violation and be reported to the Honor Council.|
|**Students with Disabilities**|I am available to discuss appropriate academic accommodations that may be required for student with disabilities. Requests for academic accommodations are to be made during the first three weeks of the semester, except for unusual circumstances. Students are encouraged to register with Office of Students with Disabilities, G-664 Haven Hall, 763-3000, http://ssd.umich.edu/ to verify their eligibility for appropriate accommodations.|
|**Diversity Statement**|All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class. I consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect, and I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability and other visible and non-visible differences.|
|**Student Resources**|If you require additional resources please contact the Office of Student Support and Accountability, ossa.engin.umich.edu or engin-support@umich.edu. In addition, if you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via caps.umich.edu/mitalk|

### Lecture Schedule <a id="Schedule"></a>

*Please note this schedule is tentative!!!*

The course is divided into three main components based on the general events associated with a radiation effects. These are: (i) The radiation damage event, (ii) Point defect generation, recombination and mobility, and (III) the formation of extended defects. Each section schedule is provided below:

#### Part I: The Radiation Damage Event
*Objective:* Develop a fundamental understanding of the physics of the radiation damage event
